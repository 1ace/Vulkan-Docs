This extension adds a new elink:VkPolygonMode enum where a triangle is
rasterized by computing and filling its axis-aligned screen-space bounding
box, disregarding the actual triangle edges.
This can be useful for drawing a rectangle without being split into two
triangles with an internal edge.
It is also useful to minimize the number of primitives that need to be
drawn, particularly for a user interface.
