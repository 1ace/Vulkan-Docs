Applications that wish to import Direct3D 11 memory objects into the Vulkan
API may wish to use the native keyed mutex mechanism to synchronize access
to the memory between Vulkan and Direct3D.
This extension provides a way for an application to access the keyed mutex
associated with an imported Vulkan memory object when submitting command
buffers to a queue.
