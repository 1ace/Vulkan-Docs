This extension defines two new structures and a function to assign SMPTE
(the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) 2086 metadata to a
swapchain.
This is the Vulkan equivalent to the EGL_EXT_surface_SMPTE2086_metadata
extension.
The SMPTE 2086 metadata includes the color primaries, white point, and
luminance range of the mastering display, which all together define the
color volume that contains all the possible colors the mastering display can
produce.
The mastering display is the display where creative work is done and
creative intent is established.
To preserve such creative intent as much as possible and achieve consistent
color reproduction on different viewing displays, it is useful for the
display pipeline to know the color volume of the original mastering display
where content was created or tuned.
This avoids performing unnecessary mapping of colors that are not
displayable on the original mastering display.

While the general purpose of the metadata is to assist in the transformation
between different color volumes of different displays and help achieve
better color reproduction, it is not in the scope of this extension to
define how exactly the metadata should be used in such a process.
It is up to the implementation to determine how to make use of the metadata.

=== New Structures

  * slink:VkXYColorEXT
  * slink:VkSMPTE2086MetadataEXT

=== New Functions

  * flink:vkSetSMPTE2086MetadataEXT

=== Issues

1) Do we need a query function?

   PROPOSED: No, Vulkan does not provide queries for state that the
   application can track on it's own.

2) Should we specify default if not specified by the application?

   PROPOSED: No, that leaves the default up to the display or the
   implementation which may be more typical.
