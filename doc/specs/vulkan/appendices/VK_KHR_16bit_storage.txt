The +VK_KHR_16bit_storage+ extension allows use of 16-bit types in shader
input and output interfaces, and push constant blocks.
This extension introduces several new optional features which map to SPIR-V
capabilities and allow access to 16-bit data in code:Block-decorated objects
in the code:Uniform and the code:StorageBuffer storage classes, and objects
in the code:PushConstant storage class.
This extension allows 16-bit variables to be declared and used as
user-defined shader inputs and outputs but does not change location
assignment and component assignment rules.
