When allocating memory that may: be exported to another process or {apiname}
instance, set the pname:pNext pointer of slink:VkMemoryAllocateInfo to refer
to a slink:VkExportMemoryAllocateInfoNV structure and set pname:handleTypes
to a non-zero value.  Multiple handle types may: be requested for the same
allocation as long as they are compatible, as reported by
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceExternalMemoryFormatPropertiesNV.
