[open,refpage='VkSampler',desc='Opaque handle to a sampler object',type='handles']
--

sname:VkSampler objects represent the state of an image sampler which is
used by the implementation to read image data and apply filtering and other
transformations for the shader.

Samplers are represented by sname:VkSampler handles:

[open,refpage='vkCreateSampler',desc='Create a new sampler object',type='protos']

To create a sampler object, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCreateSampler.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the sampler.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkSamplerCreateInfo structure specifying the state of the sampler
    object.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pSampler points to a slink:VkSampler handle in which the resulting
    sampler object is returned.

  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.

    filter to apply to lookups.
  * pname:minFilter is a elink:VkFilter value specifying the minification
    filter to apply to lookups.

    mipmap LOD calculation and bias provided by image sampling functions in
    SPIR-V, as described in the <<textures-level-of-detail-operation,
    Level-of-Detail Operation>> section.
  * [[samplers-maxAnisotropy]] pname:anisotropyEnable is ename:VK_TRUE to
    enable anisotropic filtering, as described in the
    <<textures-texel-anisotropic-filtering, Texel Anisotropic Filtering>>
    section, or ename:VK_FALSE otherwise.
  * pname:maxAnisotropy is the anisotropy value clamp.
  * pname:compareEnable is ename:VK_TRUE to enable comparison against a
    reference value during lookups, or ename:VK_FALSE otherwise.
  ** Note: Some implementations will default to shader state if this member
     does not match.
  * pname:compareOp is a elink:VkCompareOp value specifying the comparison
    function to apply to fetched data before filtering as described in the
    <<textures-depth-compare-operation, Depth Compare Operation>> section.
  * pname:minLod and pname:maxLod are the values used to clamp the computed
    level-of-detail value, as described in the

  * pname:borderColor is a elink:VkBorderColor value specifying the
    predefined border color to use.
  * [[samplers-unnormalizedCoordinates]] pname:unnormalizedCoordinates
    controls whether to use unnormalized or normalized texel coordinates to
    address texels of the image.
    When set to ename:VK_TRUE, the range of the image coordinates used to
    lookup the texel is in the range of zero to the image dimensions for x,
    y and z.
    When set to ename:VK_FALSE the range of image coordinates is zero to

    When pname:unnormalizedCoordinates is ename:VK_TRUE, samplers have the
    following requirements:
  ** pname:minFilter and pname:magFilter must: be equal.
  ** pname:mipmapMode must: be ename:VK_SAMPLER_MIPMAP_MODE_NEAREST.
  ** pname:minLod and pname:maxLod must: be zero.
  ** pname:addressModeU and pname:addressModeV must: each be either
     ename:VK_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_CLAMP_TO_EDGE or
     ename:VK_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_CLAMP_TO_BORDER.
  ** pname:anisotropyEnable must: be ename:VK_FALSE.
  ** pname:compareEnable must: be ename:VK_FALSE.
  * When pname:unnormalizedCoordinates is ename:VK_TRUE, images the sampler
    is used with in the shader have the following requirements:
  ** The pname:viewType must: be either ename:VK_IMAGE_VIEW_TYPE_1D or
     ename:VK_IMAGE_VIEW_TYPE_2D.
  ** The image view must: have a single layer and a single mip level.
  * When pname:unnormalizedCoordinates is ename:VK_TRUE, image built-in
    functions in the shader that use the sampler have the following
    requirements:
  ** The functions must: not use projection.
  ** The functions must: not use offsets.

[NOTE]
.Mapping of OpenGL to Vulkan filter modes
==================
pname:magFilter values of ename:VK_FILTER_NEAREST and ename:VK_FILTER_LINEAR
directly correspond to code:GL_NEAREST and code:GL_LINEAR magnification
filters.
pname:minFilter and pname:mipmapMode combine to correspond to the similarly
named OpenGL minification filter of code:GL_minFilter_MIPMAP_mipmapMode
(e.g. pname:minFilter of ename:VK_FILTER_LINEAR and pname:mipmapMode of
ename:VK_SAMPLER_MIPMAP_MODE_NEAREST correspond to
code:GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST).

There are no Vulkan filter modes that directly correspond to OpenGL
minification filters of code:GL_LINEAR or code:GL_NEAREST, but they can: be
emulated using ename:VK_SAMPLER_MIPMAP_MODE_NEAREST, pname:minLod = 0, and
pname:maxLod = 0.25, and using pname:minFilter = ename:VK_FILTER_LINEAR or
pname:minFilter = ename:VK_FILTER_NEAREST, respectively.

Note that using a pname:maxLod of zero would cause
<<textures-texel-filtering,magnification>> to always be performed, and the
pname:magFilter to always be used.
This is valid, just not an exact match for OpenGL behavior.
Clamping the maximum LOD to 0.25 allows the [eq]#{lambda}# value to be
non-zero and minification to be performed, while still always rounding down
to the base level.
If the pname:minFilter and pname:magFilter are equal, then using a
pname:maxLod of zero also works.
==================

The maximum number of sampler objects which can: be simultaneously created
on a device is implementation-dependent and specified by the
<<features-limits-maxSamplerAllocationCount,pname:maxSamplerAllocationCount>>
member of the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits structure.
If pname:maxSamplerAllocationCount is exceeded, fname:vkCreateSampler will
return ename:VK_ERROR_TOO_MANY_OBJECTS.

Since slink:VkSampler is a non-dispatchable handle type, implementations
may: return the same handle for sampler state vectors that are identical.
In such cases, all such objects would only count once against the
pname:maxSamplerAllocationCount limit.
