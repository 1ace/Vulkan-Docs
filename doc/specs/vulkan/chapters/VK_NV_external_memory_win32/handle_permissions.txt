When pname:VkExportMemoryAllocateInfoNV::handleTypes includes
ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_OPAQUE_WIN32_BIT_NV, set the pname:pNext
pointer of slink:VkExportMemoryAllocateInfoNV to refer to a
slink:VkExportMemoryWin32HandleInfoNV structure to specify security attributes
and access rights for the memory object's external handle.

include::../../api/structs/VkExportMemoryWin32HandleInfoNV.txt[]

If this structure is not present, or if pAttributes is set to NULL, default
security descriptor values will: be used, and child processes created by the
application will not inherit the handle, as described in the MSDN documentation
for "Synchronization Object Security and Access Rights"[1].  Further, if the
structure is not present, the access rights will: be
    
    DXGI_SHARED_RESOURCE_READ | DXGI_SHARED_RESOURCE_WRITE
