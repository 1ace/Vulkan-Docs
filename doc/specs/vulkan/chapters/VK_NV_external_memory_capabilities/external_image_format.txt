// refBegin vkGetPhysicalDeviceExternalImageFormatPropertiesNV determine image capabilities compatible with external memory handle types

To determine the image capabilities compatible with an external
memory handle type, call:

include::../../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceExternalImageFormatPropertiesNV.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    image capabilities
  * pname:format is the image format, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:format.
  * pname:type is the image type, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:imageType.
  * pname:tiling is the image tiling, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:tiling.
  * pname:usage is the intended usage of the image, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:usage.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask describing additional parameters of the image,
    corresponding to slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:flags.
  * pname:externalHandleType is either one of the bits from
    slink:VkExternalMemoryHandleTypeFlagBitsNV, or 0.
  * pname:pExternalImageFormatProperties points to an instance of the
    slink:VkExternalImageFormatPropertiesNV structure in which capabilities
    are returned.

If pname:externalHandleType is 0,
slink:VkExternalImageFormatPropertiesNV::imageFormatProperties will
return the same values as a call to
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties, and the other members
of slink:VkExternalImageFormatPropertiesNV will all be 0.

Otherwise, the members of
slink:VkExternalImageFormatPropertiesNV will be populated as
follows:

  * pname:imageFormatProperties will: be filled in as when calling
    flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatPropertiesNV, but the values
    returned may vary depending on the external handle type requested.
  * pname:externalMemoryFeatures is a bitmask containing one or more of
    VkExternalMemoryFeatureFlagBitsNV.
  * pname:exportFromImportedHandleTypes will: contain a bit for every
    external handle type that can be used to create memory from which the
    handles of the type specified in pname:externalHandleType can be
    exported.
  * pname:compatibleHandleTypes will: contain a list of all the handle types
    that may be specified simulatenously with the handle type specified by
    pname:externalHandleType when calling flink:vkAllocateMemory.
    pname:compatibleHandleTypes will always contain
    pname:externalHandleType.

The bits in slink:VkExternalMemoryFeatureFlagBitsNV are defined as
follows:

  * ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_FEATURE_DEDICATED_ONLY_BIT_NV
    External memory of the specified type must be created as a
    dedicated allocation when used in the manner specified.
  * ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_FEATURE_EXPORTABLE_BIT_NV
    The implementation supports exporting handles of the specified
    type.
  * ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_FEATURE_IMPORTABLE_BIT_NV
    The implementation supports importing handles of the specified
    type.
