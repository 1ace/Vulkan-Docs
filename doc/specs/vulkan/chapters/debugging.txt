= Debugging

To aid developers in tracking down errors in the application's use of
Vulkan, particularly in combination with an external debugger or profiler,
_debugging extensions_ may be available.

// refBegin VkObjectType Specify an enumeration to track object handle types
The elink:VkObjectType enumeration defines values, each of which corresponds
to a specific Vulkan handle type.
These values can: be used to associate debug information with a particular
type of object through one or more extensions.

include::../api/enums/VkObjectType.txt[]
// refEnd VkObjectType

If this Specification was generated with any such extensions included, they
will be described in the remainder of this chapter.
