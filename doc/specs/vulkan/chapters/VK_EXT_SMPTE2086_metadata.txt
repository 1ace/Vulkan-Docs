== SMPTE2086 Metadata

To improve color reproduction of content it is useful to have information
that can be used to better reproduce the colors as seen on the mastering
display.
That information can be provided to an implementation by calling
fname:vkSetSMPTE2086MetadataEXT.
The metadata will be applied to the specified sname:VkSwapchainKHR objects
at the next fname:vkQueuePresentKHR call using that sname:VkSwapchainKHR
object.
The metadata will persist until a subsequent fname:vkSetSMPTE2086MetadataEXT
changes it.
The defintions below are from the associated SMPTE2086 and CIE 15:2004
specifications.

The definition of fname:vkSetSMPTE2086MetadataEXT is:

// refBegin vkSetSMPTE2086MetadataEXT function to set SMPTE2086 metadata
include::../api/protos/vkSetSMPTE2086MetadataEXT.txt[]

  * pname:device is the logical device where the swapchain(s) were created.
  * pname:swapchainCount is the number of swapchains included in
    pname:pSwapchains.
  * pname:pSwapchains is a pointer to the array of pname:swapchainCount
    sname:VkSwapchainKHR handles.
  * pname:pMetadata is a pointer to the array of pname:swapchainCount
    sname:VkSMPTE2086MetadataEXT structures.

// refBegin VkXYColorEXT structure to specify X,Y chromaticity coordinates
include::../api/structs/VkXYColorEXT.txt[]
Chromaticity coordinates x and y are as specified in CIE 15:2004
"Calculation of chromaticity coordinates" (Section 7.3) and are limited to
between 0 and 1 for real colors for the mastering display.

  * pname:displayPrimaryRed is the mastering display's red primary in
    chromaticity coordinates
  * pname:displayPrimaryGreen is the mastering display's green primary in
    chromaticity coordinates
  * pname:displayPrimaryBlue is the mastering display's blue primary in
    chromaticity coordinates
  * pname:whitePoint is the mastering display's white-point in chromaticity
    coordinates
  * pname:maxLuminance is the maximum luminance of the mastering display in
    nits
  * pname:minLuminance is the minimum luminance of the mastering display in
    nits
