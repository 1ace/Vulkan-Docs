When submitting work that operates on memory imported from a Direct3D
11 resource to a queue, the keyed mutex mechanism may be used in
addition to Vulkan semaphores to synchronize the work.  Keyed mutexes
are a property of a properly created shareable Direct3D 11 resource.
They can only be used if the imported resource was created with the
D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_SHARED_KEYEDMUTEX flag.

To acquire keyed mutexes before submitted work and/or release them
after, set the pname:pNext parameter of slink:VkSubmitInfo to refer
to a slink:VkWin32KeyedMutexAcquireReleaseInfoNV structure:

include::../../api/structs/VkWin32KeyedMutexAcquireReleaseInfoNV.txt[]

    acquireCount: The number of entries in the pAcquireSyncs,
                  pAcquireKeys, and pAcquireTimeoutMilliseconds
                  arrays.
    
    pAcquireSyncs: An array of VkDeviceMemory objects which were
                   imported from Direct3D 11 resources.

    pAcquireKeys: An array of mutex key values to wait for prior to
                  beginning the submitted work.  Entries refer to
                  the keyed mutex associated with the corresponding
                  entries in pAcquireSyncs.

    pAcquireTimeoutMilliseconds: Timeout values for each acquire
                                 specified in pAcquireKeys.

    releaseCount: The number of entries in the pReleaseSyncs and
                  pReleaseKeys arrays.

    pReleaseSyncs: An array of VkDeviceMemory objects which were
                   imported from Direct3D 11 resources.
                   
    pReleaseKeys: An array of mutex key values to set when the
                  submitted work has completed.  Entries refer to
                  the keyed mutex associated with the corresponding
                  entries in pReleaseSyncs.
